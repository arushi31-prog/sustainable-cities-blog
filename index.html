    <h1>Sustainable Cities and Smart Urban Planning</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="container">
    <p>As urban populations grow and environmental challenges intensify, the need for sustainable cities and smart urban planning has never been greater. Sustainable cities aim to balance economic development, social inclusivity, and environmental conservation, ensuring a high quality of life for current and future generations.</p>
    <p>Through smart urban planning, cities integrate innovative solutions to manage resources efficiently, reduce carbon footprints, and create resilient, livable communities. These strategies include adopting renewable energy, green infrastructure, sustainable transportation, and technology-driven urban management.</p>
    <p>By combining sustainability with smart planning, cities can address issues like climate change, waste management, and urban congestion, transforming into intelligent, eco-conscious urban ecosystems. The success of this approach can be seen in cities worldwide, including Copenhagen, Singapore, and several Indian cities like Mysore and Chandigarh.</p>
    <p>Investing in sustainable urban development ensures that cities remain vibrant, efficient, and adaptable in the face of modern challenges.</p>
